2. All functionality can be accessed through the GUI. This will be displayed after running main.py.

3. The database is already setup in a "default" state. You can use the "RESET DATABASE" button on the main window to restore the database to default. (This is useful for testing purposes)

Username: "John"
Password: "Password1"
can be used for quick access and testing
